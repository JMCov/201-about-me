      When I was in elementary school, dodgeball was my favorite sport, followed by kickball. Unfortunately, there
      wasn't very much of either sport after middle school, these were the dark times. When I was in the Navy, I lead my
      class to a dodgeball championship; it was pretty okay. When I moved to Portland, I joined an adult sports league;
      some of the people were the worst, but it was good times returning to recess. These days, I don't get to play a
      lot of dodgeball, but I have met a lot of friends traveling the country to compete in kickball. That's pretty much
      it. My goal is to continue to play games for the rest of my life.
