      Past Gaming History
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dodgeball was my favorite recess sport in elementary school.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kickball was my second favorite reces sport.
      </li>
      <li>
        There was no recess after middle school, these were dark times.
      </li>
      <li>
        I lead my class to dodgeball glory in the Navy; it was okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        I moved to Portland & joined adult recess sports; some of the people were the worst.
      </li>
      <li>
        I don't play dodgeball much anymore, but I travel & meet friends playing kickball.
      </li>
      <li>
        My goal is to continue to play games for the rest of my life.
